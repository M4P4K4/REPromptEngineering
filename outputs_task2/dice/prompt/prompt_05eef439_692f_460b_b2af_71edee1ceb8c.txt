The requirements are:
1. A dice-throwing game for three players. 
2. Every player starts with 0 points. 
3. The players take turns. 
4. With each turn, a player throws a dice. 
5. The dice count gets added to the player's points. 
6. The dice count and the player points are then printed. 
7. The game ends after 12 turns. 
8. The game also terminates if one player has significantly more points than the others.
