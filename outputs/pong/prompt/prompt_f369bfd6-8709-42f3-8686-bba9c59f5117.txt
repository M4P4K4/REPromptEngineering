Create java code for the following description of a game: The game is a two-players game for a console with two manual controllers to control the movement of a paddle. The goal is to score points by hitting a ball past the opponent's paddle. The first player who reaches 10 points wins and the game ends. The board consists of a rectangular arrangement of k rectangular blocks. The sides of the board have a ratio of 2/3, with the longer side as the base. The rectangular blocks composing the board have a measure of n x m pixels, where n is the width and m is the height. The paddle are n x m rectangular blocks, with the shorter side as the base. Paddles are positioned alongside the vertical sides of the board. The ball consist in a n x n square. When the game starts the ball moves in a straight line from the centre of the screen toward the left side of the board, with a speed of 1cm/sec. The paddles are in the middle of the vertical sides. The paddle of player 1 is on the left side and the paddle of player 2 is on the right side. Player 1 controls the left paddle, and player 2 controls the right paddle. The paddles can only move up and down, controlled by the manual controllers on the console (one for each player). The ball direction changes every time the ball hits the paddle or the upper and bottom sides of the board according to the law of elastic collisions. A player scores a point when the opponent fails to return the ball. The ball must pass the opponent's paddle and touch the vertical sides to score a point. If the ball hits the wall behind a player, the opponent player receives a point. After a player scores a point, the game resets (the paddles are in the middle of the vertical side and the ball is at the centre of the board), and the ball moves straight line toward the side of the player who was scored against. The ball speed increase of 10% of its current speed every time the ball hits the upper or bottom sides of the board or a paddle. The player can select between “2 person” mode and “player vs. computer” mode. If they select “player vs. computer” mode, only the left paddle is controlled by a manual controller, while the right paddle is controlled by the computer. If they select “2 person” mode, the game is played as explained before.
