Create java code for the following description of a game: The game board shall be of size k x k pixels, where k shall be given as input by the user. The sides of the board have a ratio of 2/3, with the longer side as the base. The square blocks composing the board have a measure of n x n. When the game starts the board is initialised with a snake and a piece of food. The snake is represented as a single green square (n x n), positioned on the bottom left square of the board, oriented upwards. The piece of food is represented as a single red square (n x n) positioned in a random position on the board. The goal of the game is to grow the snake by making it eating food, until it fills the entire board. The snake moves continuously with a speed of 1cm/sec. If the snake touches a board side the game is over. If the snake touches its own body the game is over. When the user presses up/down/right/left on the keyboard, the snake’s orientation moves into the corresponding direction The snake eats the food when it touches it (namely every time the snake passes over the food on the board). Every time the snake eats a piece of food, a new one appears in a random position on the board. Every time the snake eats a piece of food, its body grows by one square (n x n) which gets attached at the end of its body. Every time the snake eats a piece of food, its speed increases by 1%. The user can set the difficulty to easy or hard. If the user selects “easy”, the snake moves with a speed of 5 pixels per second. If the user selects “hard”, the snake moves with a speed of 10 pixels per second.
