Here is a simple implementation of the game in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DiceGame {
    private static final int MAX_TURNS = 12;
    private static final int MAX_DIFF = 10;
    private static final int MAX_POINTS = 10;
    private static final int MAX_DICE = 6;
    private static final String[] COLORS = {"Red", "Green", "Blue", "Purple"};
    private static final String COMPUTER = "Computer";
    private static final Random RANDOM = new Random();

    private String[] players = new String[3];
    private int[] points = new int[3];
    private String[] colors = new String[3];
    private int turn = 0;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DiceGame game = new DiceGame();
        game.start();
    }

    private void start() {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            System.out.println("Enter name for player " + (i + 1) + ":");
            players[i] = scanner.nextLine();
            while (players[i].equals(COMPUTER)) {
                System.out.println("Name cannot be Computer. Enter another name:");
                players[i] = scanner.nextLine();
            }
            colors[i] = COLORS[i];
        }

        while (turn < MAX_TURNS && !isGameOver()) {
            int player = turn % 3;
            int dice = RANDOM.nextInt(MAX_DICE) + 1;
            if (dice == 1) dice = RANDOM.nextInt(MAX_DICE) + 1;
            if (dice == 2) dice *= 3;
            else if (dice % 2 == 0) dice /= 2;
            points[player] += dice;
            if (points[player] > MAX_POINTS) colors[player] = COLORS[3];
            System.out.println("Player " + players[player] + " rolled a " + dice + ". Total points: " + points[player] + ". Color: " + colors[player]);
            if (dice == 6) turn++;
            turn++;
            if (points[0] == points[1] && points[1] == points[2]) System.out.println("Equality!");
        }

        int winner = points[0] > points[1] ? (points[0] > points[2] ? 0 : 2) : (points[1] > points[2] ? 1 : 2);
        System.out.println("Congratulations " + players[winner] + " you won the game! You are the best!");
    }

    private boolean isGameOver() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < 3; j++) {
                if (Math.abs(points[i] - points[j]) >= MAX_DIFF) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

This code creates a simple dice game for three players. It asks for the names of the players and checks if the name is "Computer". If it is, it asks for another name. It then starts the game and continues until 12 turns have passed or one player has 10 more points than any other player. The points and colors of the players are printed after each turn. If a player's points get above 10, their color turns purple. If a player rolls a 6, the next player's turn is skipped. If the dice count is even but not 2, it is halved. If the dice count is 2, it is tripled. If the points turn equal at any point in the game, the game prints "Equality!". The winner is the player with the most points at the end of the game.
