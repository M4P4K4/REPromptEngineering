Create java code for the following description of a game: A dice-throwing game for three players. Every player starts with 0 points. The players take turns. With each turn, a player throws a dice. The dice count gets added to the player's points. The dice count and the player points are then printed. The game ends after 12 turns. The game also terminates if one player has significantly more points than the others. If the dice count is 1, the player may possibly throw the dice again. There will be some sort of congratulations for the winner. The player point colors shall always be red, green, and blue for player 1, player 2, and player 3 respectively. If the points get above 10, they shall turn purple. If the current player throws a 6, the next player’s turn is skipped.
If the previous player threw a 6, the current player can throw their dice twice. If the dice count is even, it shall be halved.
If the dice count is 2, it shall be tripled. All players’ points shall be colored in different colors.
If they turn equal at any point in the game, the game shall print: “Equality!”. The players’ turn order must be decided at the beginning of the game. The players’ names shall not be “Computer”.
