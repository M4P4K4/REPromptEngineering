Here is a simple implementation of the game in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DiceGame {
    private static final int MAX_TURNS = 12;
    private static final int MAX_POINTS_DIFFERENCE = 10;
    private static final int MAX_POINTS_COLOR_CHANGE = 10;
    private static final int DICE_SIDES = 6;

    private static class Player {
        String name;
        int points;
        String color;

        Player(String name, String color) {
            this.name = name;
            this.points = 0;
            this.color = color;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Random random = new Random();

        Player[] players = new Player[3];
        String[] colors = {"red", "green", "blue"};

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            System.out.println("Enter name for player " + (i + 1) + ":");
            String name = scanner.nextLine();
            while (name.equalsIgnoreCase("Computer")) {
                System.out.println("Name cannot be Computer. Enter another name:");
                name = scanner.nextLine();
            }
            players[i] = new Player(name, colors[i]);
        }

        List<Player> turnOrder = Arrays.asList(players);
        Collections.shuffle(turnOrder);

        int turn = 0;
        while (turn < MAX_TURNS) {
            for (Player player : turnOrder) {
                int diceCount = random.nextInt(DICE_SIDES) + 1;
                if (diceCount == 1) diceCount = random.nextInt(DICE_SIDES) + 1;
                if (diceCount == 2) diceCount *= 3;
                else if (diceCount % 2 == 0) diceCount /= 2;
                player.points += diceCount;
                if (player.points > MAX_POINTS_COLOR_CHANGE) player.color = "purple";
                System.out.println(player.name + " rolled a " + diceCount + ". Total points: " + player.points + ". Color: " + player.color);
                if (player.points >= MAX_POINTS_DIFFERENCE && player.points - turnOrder.get((turnOrder.indexOf(player) + 1) % 3).points >= MAX_POINTS_DIFFERENCE && player.points - turnOrder.get((turnOrder.indexOf(player) + 2) % 3).points >= MAX_POINTS_DIFFERENCE) {
                    System.out.println("Congratulations " + player.name + ", you won the game! You are the best!");
                    return;
                }
                if (diceCount == 6) break;
                turn++;
                if (turn >= MAX_TURNS) break;
            }
            if (players[0].points == players[1].points && players[1].points == players[2].points) System.out.println("Equality!");
        }
    }
}
```

This code creates a `Player` class to store each player's name, points, and color. It then asks for the names of the three players, ensuring that none of them are named "Computer". It shuffles the turn order randomly, then begins the game. Each player's turn consists of rolling a dice, adjusting the dice count according to the rules, and adding the dice count to the player's points. If a player's points exceed 10, their color is changed to purple. If a player's points are 10 more than both other players, they are declared the winner and the game ends. If a player rolls a 6, the next player's turn is skipped. If all players have the same number of points, the game prints "Equality!". The game ends after 12 turns.
