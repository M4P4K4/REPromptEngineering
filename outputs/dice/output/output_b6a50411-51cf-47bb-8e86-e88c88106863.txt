Here is a simple implementation of the game in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DiceGame {
    private static final int MAX_TURNS = 12;
    private static final int MAX_DIFF = 10;
    private static final int MAX_POINTS = 10;
    private static final int DICE_SIDES = 6;
    private static final String[] COLORS = {"red", "green", "blue", "purple"};
    private static final Random RANDOM = new Random();

    private static class Player {
        String name;
        int points;
        String color;

        Player(String name, String color) {
            this.name = name;
            this.points = 0;
            this.color = color;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Player[] players = new Player[3];
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            System.out.println("Enter player " + (i + 1) + " name:");
            String name = scanner.nextLine();
            while (name.equals("Computer")) {
                System.out.println("Name cannot be Computer. Enter another name:");
                name = scanner.nextLine();
            }
            players[i] = new Player(name, COLORS[i]);
        }

        int turn = 0;
        while (turn < MAX_TURNS) {
            for (Player player : players) {
                int dice = RANDOM.nextInt(DICE_SIDES) + 1;
                if (dice == 1) dice = RANDOM.nextInt(DICE_SIDES) + 1;
                if (dice == 2) dice *= 3;
                else if (dice % 2 == 0) dice /= 2;
                player.points += dice;
                if (player.points > MAX_POINTS) player.color = COLORS[3];
                System.out.println(player.name + " rolled a " + dice + ". Total points: " + player.points + ". Color: " + player.color);
                if (checkWinCondition(players)) {
                    System.out.println("Congratulations " + player.name + " you won the game! You are the best!");
                    return;
                }
                if (dice == 6) break;
                turn++;
                if (turn >= MAX_TURNS) return;
            }
        }
    }

    private static boolean checkWinCondition(Player[] players) {
        for (int i = 0; i < players.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < players.length; j++) {
                if (Math.abs(players[i].points - players[j].points) >= MAX_DIFF) return true;
                if (players[i].points == players[j].points) System.out.println("Equality!");
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

This code creates a `Player` class to store each player's name, points, and color. The `main` method prompts each player to enter their name, then starts the game. Each player takes turns rolling the dice, with the dice roll being adjusted according to the rules. The player's points and color are updated and printed after each roll. The game ends if a player's points are 10 more than any other player's points, or after 12 turns. If a player rolls a 6, the next player's turn is skipped. If the dice roll is 2, it is tripled; if it is even but not 2, it is halved. If the players' points are equal at any point, the game prints "Equality!".
