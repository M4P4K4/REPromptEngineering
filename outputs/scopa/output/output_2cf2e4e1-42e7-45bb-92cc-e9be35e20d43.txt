Due to the complexity of the game, the full code would be too long to post here. However, I can provide you with a basic structure of the classes and methods you would need to implement this game in Java.

```java
public class Card {
    private String suit;
    private int value;
    private int points;

    // constructor, getters, setters
}

public class Player {
    private List<Card> hand;
    private List<Card> pile;
    private int score;

    // constructor, getters, setters
    // methods to play a card, take cards, calculate points
}

public class Game {
    private List<Player> players;
    private List<Card> deck;
    private List<Card> table;
    private int targetScore;
    private Player dealer;

    // constructor, getters, setters
    // methods to deal cards, determine turn order, check for win condition
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // create game, players, and deck
        // while no player has reached target score, play rounds
        // after each round, calculate points and check for win condition
        // if win condition met, declare winner and end game
    }
}
```

This is a very simplified version of what your code might look like. You would need to add a lot more logic to handle the specific rules of the game, such as determining the value of each card, deciding which cards a player can take, calculating points, etc. You might also want to add some user interface code to allow players to interact with the game.
