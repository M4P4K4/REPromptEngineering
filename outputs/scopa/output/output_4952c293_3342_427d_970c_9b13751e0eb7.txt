Due to the complexity of the game, the full implementation of the game would be too large to fit here. However, I can provide you with a basic structure of the classes and methods that you would need to implement this game.

```java
public class Card {
    private String suit;
    private int value;

    public Card(String suit, int value) {
        this.suit = suit;
        this.value = value;
    }

    // getters and setters
}

public class Player {
    private List<Card> hand;
    private List<Card> pile;
    private int score;

    public Player() {
        hand = new ArrayList<>();
        pile = new ArrayList<>();
        score = 0;
    }

    // methods to play a card, take cards, calculate score, etc.
}

public class Deck {
    private List<Card> cards;

    public Deck() {
        cards = new ArrayList<>();
        // initialize the deck with 40 cards
    }

    public void shuffle() {
        // shuffle the deck
    }

    public Card draw() {
        // draw a card from the deck
    }
}

public class Game {
    private List<Player> players;
    private Deck deck;
    private int targetScore;

    public Game(int numPlayers, int targetScore) {
        players = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numPlayers; i++) {
            players.add(new Player());
        }
        deck = new Deck();
        this.targetScore = targetScore;
    }

    public void play() {
        // main game loop
    }
}
```

In the `Player` class, you would need methods to play a card, take cards from the table, calculate the score, etc. In the `Deck` class, you would need methods to shuffle the deck and draw a card. In the `Game` class, you would need a main game loop that handles the game logic, such as dealing cards, taking turns, checking for a winner, etc.
