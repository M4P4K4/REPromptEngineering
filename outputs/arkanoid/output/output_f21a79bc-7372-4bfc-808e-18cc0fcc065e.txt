Due to the complexity of the game, the full implementation would be too large to fit here. However, I can provide a basic structure of the classes and methods that would be needed to implement this game. 

```java
public class Game {
    private int level;
    private int lives;
    private Board board;
    private Paddle paddle;
    private Ball ball;

    public Game() {
        // Initialize game
    }

    public void start() {
        // Start the game
    }

    public void nextLevel() {
        // Proceed to the next level
    }

    public void loseLife() {
        // Lose a life and restart the level if lives remain
    }

    public void gameOver() {
        // End the game
    }
}

public class Board {
    private int width;
    private int height;
    private List<Brick> bricks;

    public Board() {
        // Initialize board
    }

    public void generateBricks() {
        // Generate bricks for the current level
    }
}

public class Paddle {
    private int position;

    public Paddle() {
        // Initialize paddle
    }

    public void moveLeft() {
        // Move paddle to the left
    }

    public void moveRight() {
        // Move paddle to the right
    }
}

public class Ball {
    private int positionX;
    private int positionY;
    private int speed;
    private int direction;

    public Ball() {
        // Initialize ball
    }

    public void move() {
        // Move the ball according to its speed and direction
    }

    public void bounce() {
        // Change the direction of the ball when it hits something
    }
}

public class Brick {
    private int positionX;
    private int positionY;
    private int strength;
    private String color;

    public Brick() {
        // Initialize brick
    }

    public void hit() {
        // Decrease the strength of the brick when it is hit
    }
}
```

This is a very basic structure and does not include all the necessary methods and variables. For example, you would need methods to check for collisions between the ball and the bricks or the paddle, and to handle user input. You would also need to implement a graphical user interface to display the game.
