Due to the complexity of the game, I will provide a simplified version of the code. This code will not include all the rules and scoring system of the game, but it will give you a basic structure to start with.

```java
import java.util.*;

class Card {
    String suit;
    int value;

    public Card(String suit, int value) {
        this.suit = suit;
        this.value = value;
    }
}

class Player {
    List<Card> hand = new ArrayList<>();
    int score = 0;
}

class Game {
    List<Card> deck = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Player> players = new ArrayList<>();
    List<Card> table = new ArrayList<>();
    int targetScore;

    public Game(int numPlayers, int targetScore) {
        this.targetScore = targetScore;
        for (int i = 0; i < numPlayers; i++) {
            players.add(new Player());
        }
        String[] suits = {"Coins", "Cups", "Swords", "Clubs"};
        for (String suit : suits) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                deck.add(new Card(suit, i));
            }
        }
        Collections.shuffle(deck);
    }

    public void dealCards() {
        for (Player player : players) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                player.hand.add(deck.remove(deck.size() - 1));
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            table.add(deck.remove(deck.size() - 1));
        }
    }

    public void playRound() {
        // Simplified version of a round
        for (Player player : players) {
            Card playedCard = player.hand.remove(0);
            table.add(playedCard);
            for (Card tableCard : table) {
                if (tableCard.value == playedCard.value) {
                    player.score++;
                    table.remove(tableCard);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public void playGame() {
        while (deck.size() > 0) {
            dealCards();
            playRound();
            for (Player player : players) {
                if (player.score >= targetScore) {
                    System.out.println("Player " + players.indexOf(player) + " wins!");
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Game game = new Game(2, 21);
        game.playGame();
    }
}
```
This code creates a deck of cards, deals them to players, and plays a simplified version of a round where players play a card and if it matches a card on the table, they score a point. The game continues until a player reaches the target score or the deck is empty.
