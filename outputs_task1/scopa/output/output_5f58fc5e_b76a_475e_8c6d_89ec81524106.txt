Due to the complexity of the game, the code is quite long and does not include all the rules. It\'s a basic version of the game where players take turns drawing cards and scoring points based on the card\'s value.

It also creates a list of players and a target score. The game is played in a loop where each player draws a card from the deck and adds the card\'s value to their score. The game ends when a player reaches the target score or the deck is empty.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1711323432, model='gpt-4-0613', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=525, prompt_tokens=735, total_tokens=1260))
