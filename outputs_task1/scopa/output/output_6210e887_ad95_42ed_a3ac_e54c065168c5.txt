It creates a deck of cards and shuffles it, then deals cards to the players and the table. It then plays rounds until a player reaches the target score. In each round, players play cards from their hand, taking cards from the table if they match, and adding cards to the table if they don\'t. At the end of the round, any remaining cards on the table are taken by the last player to draw cards. The scores are then tallied, and the dealer changes.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1711322984, model='gpt-4-0613', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=697, prompt_tokens=735, total_tokens=1432))
