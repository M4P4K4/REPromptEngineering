The `Game` class has methods to initialize and shuffle the deck, add players, and start the game. The game logic is not implemented in this code. It would involve dealing cards to players, allowing players to take turns, calculating scores, and determining the winner. This would require a significant amount of additional code.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1711323753, model='gpt-4-0613', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=392, prompt_tokens=735, total_tokens=1127))
