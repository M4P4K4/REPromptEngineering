The game continues until one player reaches a score of 8. The game is played in rounds, with each player taking turns to play a card from their hand. If the card matches a card on the table, the player takes the matching cards. If not, the card is added to the table. If a player takes all the cards from the table, they earn a point. When all players have no more cards in their hand, they are dealt three new cards from the deck. The game ends when one player reaches a score of 8.', role='assistant', function_call=None, tool_calls=None))], created=1713175350, model='gpt-4-0613', object='chat.completion', system_fingerprint=None, usage=CompletionUsage(completion_tokens=640, prompt_tokens=432, total_tokens=1072))
