Create java code for the following description of a game:
1. The game is played with a deck of 40 cards, divided into four suits (Coins, Cups, Swords, and Clubs). The cards in each suit are ranked as follows: Ace (1 point), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Fante (8 points), Cavallo (9 points), and Re (10 points). 
2. The game is played by two to four players. 
3. The primary objective of Scopa is to reach a given score selected by all players before the game starts (e.g. 21). The player who first reaches the limit wins the game. To reach the score players can play different rounds. 
4. One of the players is randomly selected to play the role of “mazziere” (i.e. dealer). 
5. In addition to his/her role as a regular player, the “mazziere” will manage the card deck, i.e. give out cards to other players. 
6. When the game starts the “mazziere” mixes the card deck, then distributes three cards to each player starting from the one to his/her right and continuing counterclockwise, and places four cards face-up on the table. 
7. The first turn is performed by the player at the right of the “mazziere” and continues counterclockwise. 
8. In each turn of the game, every player has to play a card from their hand. If the value of one of their cards matches the value of a card on the table, they will take both cards. If the value of one of their cards matches the sum of two or more cards on the table, they will take all the cards. 
9. If none of their cards match the cards on the table, they must place one of their cards face up on the table. All the cards taken by the players will be placed in a separate pile alongside the player face down. 
10. Every time a player takes all the cards from the table during his turn, he earns a special point called "Scopa". The card played to achieve this is placed face up on the deck of taken cards to remember the point. 
11. When all players have no more cards on their hand (i.e. after 3 rounds) the “mazziere” deals 3 new cards for each player. 
12. Once all the cards have been distributed to the players, the round comes to an end. If there are any cards left on the table, the player who last had drawn cards will take them. 
13. After the round ends, all players tally up their points. If any player reaches the predetermined score, the game ends. If not, a new round begins. 
14. The points are as follows: each “Scopa” counts 1 point; who has more cards earns 1 point; who has more Coins cards (“Denari”) earns 1 point; who has the seven of Coins (“Settebello”) earns 1 point. The “Primiera” point is earned by the player who reach the highest score according to the following rules: cards valued 7 count 21, cards valued 6 count 18, cards valued 1 (Ace) count 16, cards valued 4 count 14, cards valued 3 count 13, cards valued 2 count 12, and cards valued 8, 9, or 10 (figures) count 10.
