Create java code for the following description of a game:
The game is played with a deck of 40 cards, divided into four suits (Coins, Cups, Swords, and Clubs). The cards in each suit are ranked as follows: Ace (1 point), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, Fante (8 points), Cavallo (9 points), and Re (10 points).
The game is played by two to four players.
The primary objective of Scopa is to reach a given score selected by all players before the game starts (e.g. 21). The player who first reaches the limit wins the game. To reach the score players can play different rounds.
The card deck gets shuffled. Then, each player receives three cards. Finally, four cards are placed on the table.
The program shall decide the playersâ€™ turn order randomly at the beginning of the game.
In each turn of the game, the player has to select a card from his hand. If the value of the selected card matches one card on the table or the sum of two or more cards on the table, the player gets the points for the matching cards including his own and the cards get discarded afterwards.
If the selected card doesn't match any card on the table, the players' card gets added to the existing cards on the table.
Every time a player takes all the cards from the table during his turn, he earns a special point called "Scopa".
When all players have no more cards on their hand (i.e. after 3 rounds), every player receives three new cards from the deck.
Once all the cards have been distributed to the players, the round comes to an end. If there are any cards left on the table, the player who last had drawn cards will take them.
After the round ends, all players tally up their points. If any player reaches the predetermined score, the game ends. If not, a new round begins.
