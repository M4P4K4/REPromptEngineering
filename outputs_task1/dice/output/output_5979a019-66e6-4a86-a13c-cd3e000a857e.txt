Here is a simple implementation of the game in Java:

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class DiceGame {
    private int[] scores = new int[3];
    private int[] turns = new int[3];
    private boolean skipNextTurn = false;
    private boolean doubleTurn = false;
    private Random random = new Random();

    public void play() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 12; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (skipNextTurn) {
                    skipNextTurn = false;
                    continue;
                }
                if (doubleTurn) {
                    doubleTurn = false;
                    turns[j]++;
                }
                turns[j]++;
                int dice = throwDice();
                if (dice == 1 && turns[j] < 2) {
                    dice += throwDice();
                }
                if (dice == 6) {
                    skipNextTurn = true;
                }
                if (dice % 2 == 0) {
                    dice /= 2;
                }
                if (dice == 2) {
                    dice *= 3;
                }
                scores[j] += dice;
                System.out.println("Player " + (j + 1) + " rolled a " + dice + ". Total score: " + scores[j]);
                if (scores[j] > 10) {
                    System.out.println("Player " + (j + 1) + "'s score is now purple!");
                }
                if (scores[0] == scores[1] && scores[1] == scores[2]) {
                    System.out.println("Equality!");
                }
                if (scores[j] > scores[(j + 1) % 3] + scores[(j + 2) % 3]) {
                    System.out.println("Player " + (j + 1) + " has significantly more points than the others. Game over!");
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
        int winner = scores[0] > scores[1] ? (scores[0] > scores[2] ? 1 : 3) : (scores[1] > scores[2] ? 2 : 3);
        System.out.println("Congratulations Player " + winner + ", you are the winner!");
    }

    private int throwDice() {
        return random.nextInt(6) + 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new DiceGame().play();
    }
}
```

This code creates a simple dice game for three players. It uses a `Random` object to simulate the dice throws. The game runs for 12 turns, or until one player has significantly more points than the others. The players' scores are stored in an array, and the current turn is tracked with a counter. The game checks for special conditions after each dice throw, such as whether the dice count is 1, 2, or 6, or whether the score is above 10. If the scores of all players are equal at any point, the game prints "Equality!". The game ends by congratulating the player with the highest score.
