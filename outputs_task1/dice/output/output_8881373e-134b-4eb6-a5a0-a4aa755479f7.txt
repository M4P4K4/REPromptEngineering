Here is a simple implementation of the game in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DiceGame {
    private static final int MAX_TURNS = 12;
    private static final int MAX_DIFF = 10;
    private static final int MAX_POINTS = 10;
    private static final int DICE_SIDES = 6;
    private static final String[] COLORS = {"red", "green", "blue", "purple"};
    private static final String[] PLAYERS = new String[3];
    private static final int[] POINTS = new int[3];
    private static final Random RANDOM = new Random();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            System.out.println("Enter name for player " + (i + 1) + ":");
            String name = scanner.nextLine();
            while (name.equalsIgnoreCase("Computer")) {
                System.out.println("Name cannot be Computer. Enter another name:");
                name = scanner.nextLine();
            }
            PLAYERS[i] = name;
        }

        int turn = 0;
        while (turn < MAX_TURNS) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                if (turn >= MAX_TURNS) break;
                int dice = RANDOM.nextInt(DICE_SIDES) + 1;
                if (dice == 1) dice = RANDOM.nextInt(DICE_SIDES) + 1;
                if (dice == 2) dice *= 3;
                else if (dice % 2 == 0) dice /= 2;
                POINTS[i] += dice;
                System.out.println(PLAYERS[i] + " rolled a " + dice + ". Total points: " + POINTS[i]);
                if (POINTS[i] > MAX_POINTS) System.out.println("Player " + PLAYERS[i] + " has turned purple!");
                if (dice == 6) i++;
                turn++;
                if (checkWin(i)) {
                    System.out.println("Congratulations " + PLAYERS[i] + " you won the game! You are the best!");
                    return;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    private static boolean checkWin(int currentPlayer) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            if (i != currentPlayer && Math.abs(POINTS[i] - POINTS[currentPlayer]) < MAX_DIFF) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

This code does not include the color changes for the player points, as it is not possible to change text color in a console application. If you want to include this feature, you would need to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for your game.
