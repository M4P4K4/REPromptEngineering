Here is a simple implementation of the game in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class DiceGame {
    private static final int MAX_TURNS = 12;
    private static final int MAX_POINTS = 10;
    private static final String COMPUTER = "Computer";
    private static final String[] COLORS = {"Red", "Green", "Blue", "Purple"};
    private static final Random RANDOM = new Random();

    private static class Player {
        String name;
        int points;
        String color;

        Player(String name, String color) {
            this.name = name;
            this.points = 0;
            this.color = color;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        Player[] players = new Player[3];

        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            System.out.println("Enter name for player " + (i + 1) + ":");
            String name = scanner.nextLine();
            while (name.equals(COMPUTER)) {
                System.out.println("Name cannot be Computer. Enter another name:");
                name = scanner.nextLine();
            }
            players[i] = new Player(name, COLORS[i]);
        }

        List<Player> playerOrder = Arrays.asList(players);
        Collections.shuffle(playerOrder);

        int turn = 0;
        while (turn < MAX_TURNS) {
            for (Player player : playerOrder) {
                int diceCount = RANDOM.nextInt(6) + 1;
                if (diceCount == 1 && RANDOM.nextBoolean()) {
                    diceCount += RANDOM.nextInt(6) + 1;
                }
                if (diceCount == 2) {
                    diceCount *= 3;
                } else if (diceCount % 2 == 0) {
                    diceCount /= 2;
                }
                player.points += diceCount;
                if (player.points > MAX_POINTS) {
                    player.color = COLORS[3];
                }
                System.out.println(player.name + " rolled a " + diceCount + ". Their points are now " + player.points + " and their color is " + player.color + ".");
                if (player.points > MAX_POINTS) {
                    System.out.println("Congratulations " + player.name + ", you won the game! You are the best!");
                    return;
                }
                if (players[0].points == players[1].points && players[1].points == players[2].points) {
                    System.out.println("Equality!");
                }
                if (diceCount == 6) {
                    break;
                }
                turn++;
                if (turn >= MAX_TURNS) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

This code creates a `Player` class to store each player's name, points, and color. It then asks for the names of the three players, ensuring that none of them are named "Computer". It shuffles the order of the players to determine the turn order. It then starts the game, with each player taking turns to roll the dice. The dice roll is adjusted according to the rules, and the player's points and color are updated. The game ends when a player reaches more than 10 points or after 12 turns.
