Create java code for the following description of a game: A dice-throwing game for three players. Every player starts with 0 points. The players take turns. With each turn, a player throws a dice. The dice count gets added to the player's points. The dice count and the player points are then printed. The game ends after 12 turns. The game also terminates if one player has significantly more points than the others. If the dice count is 1, the player may possibly throw the dice again. The winner will receive the message: “Congratulations ” + player name + “ you won the game! You are the best!” In the beginning, the player point colors shall be red, green, and blue for player 1, player 2, and player 3 respectively. If a player's points get above 10, they shall turn purple. If the current player throws a 6, the next player’s turn is skipped. If the dice count is even but not 2, it shall be halved.
If the dice count is 2, it shall be tripled. If the points turn equal at any point in the game, the game shall print: “Equality!”. The machine shall decide the players’ turn order at the beginning of the game. The players shall enter their names. If they enter “Computer”, the system shall print “Name cannot be Computer” and ask for the name again.
