Create java code for the following description of a game: The goal of the game is to complete 33 levels successfully.  The board consists of a rectangular arrangement of k rectangular blocks. The sides of the board have a ratio of 2/3, with the shorter side as the base. The rectangular blocks composing the board have a measure of n x m. At each level, the user needs to move a paddle horizontally along the bottom part of a board to hit a ball, making it change its direction upward. To successfully complete a level the user needs to break a certain number of bricks that are placed on the top part of the board, by hitting them with the ball. The bricks and the paddle are n x m rectangular blocks, with the longer side as the base. The ball has a diameter of m (the height of both the bricks and the paddle). Each brick has certain characteristics such as colour (i.e. blue, red, gold), size (i.e. single (n x m), and double bricks (2n x m)), and strength (blue bricks can be destroyed with one hit, red bricks require two hits, while gold bricks require three hits).  The board is initialised with 50 blue, single bricks randomly placed on the upper third of the board. The paddle moves horizontally on the bottom of the board, controlled by the user by left and right arrow keys. When the paddle touches the left/right border it stops (even if the user keeps clicking the keys). When each level starts the paddle is in the middle of the bottom border. When the game starts the ball falls from the top left corner of the border with a straight trajectory at a 30° angle and a speed of 1cm/sec. The ball direction changes every time the ball hits the paddle or the border of the board (except for the bottom border) with the same angle of reflection as the angle of incidence. Every time a new level starts the speed of the ball increases of 10 milliseconds. If the ball hits and breaks all the bricks, a new level with a different brick arrangement and increased difficulty begins. Each level adds two red bricks and one gold brick. The game shall generate the brick pattern and arrangement randomly. The user has 3 lives. The user loses a life every time the ball falls off the bottom of the board.  When the user loses a life but still have ones, the level re-starts with the ball falling from the top left corner of the border with a straight trajectory at a 30° angle and the speed previously set. Once the user loses all lives, the game is over. If the user want to play again the game will start again from level 1. If not, the game ends.
